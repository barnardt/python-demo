## Demonstration portfolio project in Python
### Image manipulation, OCR and facial recognition
This was the final project for the Python 3 Programming specialisation offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.  
  
This project does the following:
* Extracts image files (newspaper pages) from zip folders
* Extracts text from the images using OCR
* If the text in a given file contains a search term, find and extract all the faces in the file
* Organise the search results (faces) into contact sheets, which are displayed and saved  
  
The project demonstrates the following skills:
* Use and manipulate Python data structures like lists and dictionaries
* Python functions
* Applying external Python libraries and using their documentation
* Image manipulation using the Pillow library
* OCR using the pytesseract wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR software
* Facial recognition using the OpenCV computer vision library
* Working with files and directories in Python, including zip folders  
  
Notes:
* In addition to libraries specified in requirements.txt, the project requires installation of Tesseract to run
* Git Large File Storage (LFS) is required to clone the repo
